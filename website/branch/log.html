			<p>Today I launched my Neocities website! I'm excited about it. I think it looks pretty good for someone with essentially zero coding experience, including frontend. I'm mostly writing this jentry to fill out space on this page so it looks a bit better tbh lmao. I don't really know how to write journal entries that well? I've never been a "diary taker" kind of girl. I'll do my best to try structure this into more longform commentary in the long run, but for now I think it's just going to be kind of rambley. Idk, maybe that's more in the spirit of this like, less-polished internet anyways? I can just kind of talk I guess. I'm pretty good at that lol.<br><br>
			For this project, I had to learn a LOT of skills I didn't have before... I'd say I know a decent bit about working my way around a computer, but I didn't know some basic things like "how to set up a github repo properly." I did end up blazing thru boot.dev's python and linux basic courses (which, I'm obviously not being sponsored lol but you should give that curriculum a try if you've been interested in learning backend and have ADHD like I do -- it's gameified in a way I think is fun. Speaking of which, I gotta do my dailies! lmao.) and those were pretty satisfying! I also worked through the most of the Odin Project's frontend introduction... enough to be dangerous, I'd say! lol.<br><br>
			On another note, I think that my fianc√©e (!!!) was absolutely correct and that being on tumblr was really bad for me and encouraged a lot of bad, self-destructive behaviors for me. I'm going to try have a more measured relationship to my internet presence from now on (famous last words!) I hope that this neocities website and making other websites and webapps as my way of interacting with the internet will be productive towards that end goal.<br>
			Ok, I'd say that's probably good enough for a starting journal entry. Let's go with that. Ciao!<br><br>
			Oh! Also I'm considering trying to pick back up learning mandarin. We'll see how that goes!
