			<h1>WHADDA FAQ</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					What's your deal?
				</li>
				<p>
					We are a plural system who goes by many names for many different reasons. Among these are that we run (or ran) a number of creative projects under different names to constrain the scope of the given project. We also used to be a moderately prosperous tumblr commieblogger (under the handle "sizhens") before having scheduled freakout and deleting our blog.
				</p>
				<li>
					I used to follow Tumblr User Sizhens. Are you ever going to go back on tumblr?
				</li>
				<p>
					I sure fuckin hope not! lol! Most likely I will inevitably be drawn back by the siren song of Blue Hellsite, but for now, I am comfortably hanging out on Green Personal Journalsite.
				</p>
				<li>
					Is this website done?
				</li>
				<p>God no it's fucking half baked as hell. If you're seeing this, you're either a friend of mine who I've sent the link to, to show the website in its beta form, OR you are someone who just so happened to type in "sizhens neocities" on google or something. Skedaddle! Come back when we're ready! Shoo! We're still getting prepped here! We're not ready for company!!!</p>
				<li>I want to get in contact with Tumblr User Sizhens. How do I do that?</li>
				<p>Hey man. Don't worry about it :)</p>
